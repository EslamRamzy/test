## How to review

1. Read **00** first — it lists everything I found wrong, missing, or ambiguous in the brief.
2. Read **12** for the decisions already taken and the ones still open (**D4** is the last blocking one).
3. Everything between 01 and 11 is the proposed design. Comment on anything you want changed.
