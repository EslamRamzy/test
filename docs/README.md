# Eslam Ramzy — Portfolio Platform · Documentation

> **Status: Phase 4 of 16 complete** — authentication (Argon2id, JWT access cookie, rotating opaque
> refresh with reuse detection, lockout) and authorization (RBAC, `authenticate`/`authorize`,
> append-only audit trail) are implemented and tested against a real Express app and database. See
> the [Phase 4 report](phases/phase-04-report.md). Phase 5 (Public API) is unblocked. No open
> decisions remain that block current work — see
> [12](architecture/12-decisions-pending-approval.md) for the small number still open (including D12,
> two-factor authentication — proposed, never approved, not implemented), none of which gate the
> next phase.

## Phase reports

| Phase | Report |
|---|---|
| 1 | [Project setup](phases/phase-01-report.md) |

| 3 | [Backend foundation](phases/phase-03-report.md) |

## How to review

1. Read **00** first — it lists everything I found wrong, missing, or ambiguous in the brief.
2. Read **12** for the decisions taken and the few still open.
3. Everything between 01 and 11 is the design, corrected in place as implementation revealed real
   issues (each correction is marked inline, e.g. doc 02's Prisma 7 driver-adapter note).
